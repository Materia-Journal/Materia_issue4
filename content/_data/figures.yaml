    caption: µFTIR spectra of a) reference spectra for cellulose nitrate (from IRUG database, entry number ISR00065), poly-diallyl phthalate (IRUG entry number ISR00100), an ethyl/methyl methacrylate copolymer (IRUG entry number ISR00142) and isobutyl methacrylate (IRUG entry number ISR00057) b) spectra collected from the varnish layer of four orotones. The top two varnishes consist only of cellulose nitrate. The spectrum for PNWCSC #O2 contains cellulose nitrate as well as methacrylates and phthalates. PAM 2001.122 contains only peaks associated with phthalates and methacrylate polymers. Arrows indicate which references can be found in the sample spectra, with lines on the left indicating those references contained in the spectra indicated by arrows on the right.
    alt: FTIR reference spectra stacked on the left with arrows pointing to stacked spectra on the right from orotone samples.
